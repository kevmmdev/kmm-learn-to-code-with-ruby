# Encapsulation refers to a design paradigm where we restrict
# direct access to an object's data. Instead, we use methods
# to access and write that data, which hides away the complexity
# of the implementation and reduces the chance of bugs
#
# Example: Microwave

class Guitar
  def initialize
    @type = "Acoustic"
    @wood = "Alder"
    @strings = 6
  end

  def information
    "An #{@type} #{@wood} guitar with #{@string} strings."
  end
end

guitar = Guitar.new
p guitar.information

# p information
# p guitar.informatio
# p Guitar.information

# class String
#   def upcase
#   end

#   def split
#   end

#   def includes?
#   end
# end
